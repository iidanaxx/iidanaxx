2D Array Operations

Write a programc++ that creates a two-dimensional array initialized with test dataUse any data type you wish. The program should have the following functions:

.getTotal-This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the total of all the values in the array.

⚫getAverage-This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the average of all the values in the array. ⚫ getRowTotal-This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be

the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the total of the values

in the specified row. ⚫ getColumnTotal-This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a column in the array. The function should return the total of the values

in the specified column. ⚫getHighest InRow-This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the highest value in the

specified row of the array. .getLowest InRow-This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first

argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the lowest value in the specified row of the array.

Demonstrate each of the functions in this program
